Homework for Module 3 - Python

In this assignment, we were given raw data for PyBank, budget_data, and PyPoll, election_data, as Resource files.

With Visual Studio Code, I've created a python script for each data set, labelled as main.py within the PyBank and PyPoll folders. The scripts also created a text file inside of the folders named "analysis" for each data set.

In both PyBank and PyPoll, I've imported a csv file for raw data. 

In PyBank, the data involved the monthly recording of profit/loss. With the given data, I created a script to run financial metrics for the set, including Total Mo. Count, Total Profit/Loss, Average Change, Greatest Increase in a month, and Greatest Decrease in a month.

In PyPoll, the data involved the recorded votes for a set of candidates by county and ballot ID. With the given data, I created a script to run Total Votes counted, Percentage of vote and Votes Counted per Candidate, and also returned the winner by popular vote.
